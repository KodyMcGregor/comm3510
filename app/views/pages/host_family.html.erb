      There was one part of the trip that I was most nervous for and that was living with a host family. My biggest concern was living with parents and siblings after living on my own for four years. I was also worried about the language barrier. Would I even know what these people were saying? As it turns out, I did know what they were sayingâ€¦most of the time! My host mom and host brother were so helpful and willing to make me a part of their home. She was also a fantastic chef and I definitely never went hungry in her house. After having 14 host students before me, I guess she knew what she was doing. The only thing that surprised me about my house in Spain was how cold it was! I learned that things like heating and hot water are even more expensive in Europe than they are here. Therefore, I had to buy sweatpants and sweatshirt  for staying warm around the house!
